  Cantonese, unlike its Mandarin counterpart, possesses the unusual
  [V-T(heme)-R(eceipent)] dative word order (Matthews & Yip, 2011). According to
  Tang (1998), the Cantonese dative construction originates from the
  prepositional dative construction (PDC) where the dative marker (second bei2)
  is deleted to avoid reduplication of identical syllables. As seen in sentence
  2, the dative marker emerges when the number of syllables increases between
  the designated grammatical location of the two bei2 (俾). The goal of our study
  is to investigate whether there is a relationship between the phonological
  distance and the emergence dative marker. 


  Methods: 30 Cantonese native speakers were recruited for the purpose of the study. We used a picture description task with a logograph superimposed to prime participants to use bei2 (俾) as the main verb or in a double-bei construction. Participants were requested to name pictures denoting the transfer of possession. Responses were then coded based on their syntactic constructions (i.e. dative or double-bei) and the phonological distance (i.e. syllables after the last syllable of the subject to the first syllable of the recipient while excluding the bei2 (俾) syllable(s)).


  Results: The emergence of the dative marker were found to be strongly associated with phonological distance (Fisher’s exact = 3.43, p < 0.006). The results suggest that the use of double-bei construction corresponds to the phonological distance between the designated bei2 (俾) syllable. Taken together, the results support Tang’s (1998) account of haplology of the dative marker. The dative marker re-emerges when the phonological distance exceeds 4 syllables. However, these results should be interpreted with caution. Only 23 response tokens collected consist of phonological distance with four or more syllables with roughly equal portions of tokens distributed across construction. Moreover, only a minority of the participants (9/30; 30%) use double-bei construction; this suggests a high individual variation in the suited phonological distance for double-bei construction.
