I am a doctoral student in the East Asian Languages and Cultures Department at Indiana University, Bloomington under Charles Lin. Before IU, I did my M.A. at the University of Hong Kong under Stephen Matthews. I have also worked as a research assistant/associate at the Chinese University of Hong Kong and the Polytechnic University of Hong Kong.

Successful language usage requires the speedy activation and integration of semantic, phonological, and orthographic representations. As a psycholinguist, I am interested in how these modules interact in spoken speech. Namely, I am interested in investigating how language subsystems are co-activated in instances that are irrelevant to the task-at-hand.
